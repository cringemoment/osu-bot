# A very lame external python3 osu bot
### It goes without saying, but don't use it to cheat. 
This is a program that will read the contents of the .osu file of a song, and move the mouse to the specified position. It also reads the screen, due to some rng in the start of the song, likely to stop exactly what I'm doing right now.
  
Note: This almost 100% will not work on your computer. This was built for one very weird resolution (1280x1048) for one skin (https://circle-people.com/wp-content/Skins/Cookiezi/Cookiezi%2037%202019-08-22.osk nice trail). You could probably run this on your computer with miner modifications if you really want, but at that point just use danser or smth.
   
Relax is reccomended because 1. It won't get you banned and 2. It's more consistent. However, it works fine without relax.
